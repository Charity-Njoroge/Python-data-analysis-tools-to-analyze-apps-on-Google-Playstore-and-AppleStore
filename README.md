# Python-data-analysis-tools-to-analyze-apps-on-Google-Playstore-and-AppleStore
This project involves data analysis for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. 
The company makes its apps available on Google Play and the App Store.
They only build apps that are free to download and install, and their main source of revenue consists of in-app ads.
This means their revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use their app â€” the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. 
My goal for this project is to analyze data to help the company's developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.
In this project, I will:
1. use Python data analysis tools to analyze apps on Google Playstore and AppleStore.
2. collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on Google Play and the App Store.
3. Use this data to help developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users
